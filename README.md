This is one of the most structured, straight-forward personal projects you can do.

First, you need to learn basic Python syntax.

FreeCodeCamp has a good video-based tutorial. (You can stop right before the Regular Expressions section.)
If you want a self-paced coding-based tutorial, try out my self-serve Python curriculum. (You can stop at the Classes section of lesson4.py.)
Next, you need to find a dataset that resonates with you.

Browse Kaggle for pre-cleaned datasets.
Make your own dataset by scraping data from a website. For example, you can use scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup to scrape basketball stats from an NBA data website.
Fetch data from an existing API. For example, FinnHub provides well-formatted financial stocks data.
Next, you need to formulate some questions about your dataset.

What are your gut-feeling hunches about the dataset?
What visualizations (histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, etc) would allow you to come up with more questions?
Only you will know the right questions to ask. Your domain knowledge on the project topic will help you create new hypotheses. (This is why it helps to have passion for the project.)

Finally, you will need to figure out which statistical/data-science methods will help you answer your questions.

Linear Regression and Logistic Regression are simple methods to start with.
Tools that would help execute Regression in Python would be NumPy, Pandas, and sklearn.

If you are new to creating personal projects, this may feel overwhelming. That’s how all worthwhile projects feel. The whole point of these projects is to learn by doing. We rarely learn by doing in the American education system, so this will feel uncomfortable at first.

Here are some more resources to help you get ramped up with the skills you need to complete a project like this:

Use Google CoLab to do all your coding so that you can avoid the hassle of setting up a local coding environment that has access to all the important Python Data Science Libraries.
NumPy & Pandas are covered in Lesson 5 of my self-serve Python Curriculum. FreeCodeCamp also has a great Python Data Analysis course that covers these Libraries.
Linear Regression is covered in Lesson 6 of my self-serve Python Curriculum.
Web Scraping and Data Visualization are covered in Lesson 7 of my self-serve Python curriculum.
Project 3 in my self-serve Python curriculum provides even more structure and guidance for this type of project.
Google & YouTube are your best friend! You can do high-level queries like “Logistic Regression in Python” to get an end-to-end tutorial of this process. You can do low-level queries like “python import a csv” to get help with a small coding issue.
Here are some examples of this type of project:

My Project — NBA’s 3-Pointer Revolution
Rahul Nathan — League of Legends Data Analysis Project
